OmniWindow
=============

Extremely customizable modal window plugin for jQuery with 150 lines of code, written specially for programmers.


Main Ideas
----------

* Modal window is not an image gallery.
* HTML and CSS should be outside of the plugin code.
* You can decide yourself which animations will annoy user's eyes.
* Magic numbers and tons of options? Not here.
* Callbacks are good for javascript.
* Default behaviour should be unobtrusive.
* 150 lines of code are enough for modal window plugin.
